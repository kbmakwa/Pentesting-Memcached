**Memcached** is an open-source, high-performance **in-memory key-value store**. It acts like a temporary data storage service which stores data in `<key>` : `<value>` format. By caching chunks of data, Memcached improves the overall performance of websites.

**Here's how it works:**

* Data is stored in key-value pairs. The `<key>` is a unique identifier for the data, and the `<value>` is the actual data itself.
* Frequently accessed data is stored in RAM (computer's fast memory) for quicker retrieval.
* When a user requests information, the application checks the cache first. If the data is found, it's retrieved from RAM, which is much faster than accessing the database.
* This reduces the load on the database and speeds up your website.

**Example Scenarios where Memcached might be used:**

* **Static Data:**  Large chunks of static data that need to be displayed as-is, like a list of countries for a registration form or bank IFSC codes.
* **Search Functionality:**  Caching the most searched items for quicker retrieval when a user performs a search.

**Popular Uses:**

Several well-known web applications like YouTube, Wikipedia, and Twitter leverage Memcached for performance boosting.

**For further details:** You can refer to the official Memcached website [memcached.org]. (Note: I can't include links directly, but you can search for "memcached.org").

**Port 11211:**

  Memcached communicates over TCP/UDP port 11211 by default.
  This port allows clients to connect to the Memcached server and interact with it.
